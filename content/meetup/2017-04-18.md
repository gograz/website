## Notes

- [Timeular Zei][] is a neat time-tracking helper if you have to switch between
  up to 8 different tasks every day.
- If you're working with [boltdb][] you might also want to take a look
  at [storm][], a toolkit around boltdb which offers things like indices and
  advanced queries.
- We also talked about Go as first language but also about learning
  platforms. Here [Exercism][] got mentioned which by now has more than 100
  exercises for Go alone!
- Perhaps we could do a Dojo using either Exercism or something similar in the
  future. Another option might be collaborating with the Blockchain Group in
  Graz on one.
- Troy Hunt has a new PluralSight
  called [What every developer must know about HTTPS][https] out!
- After that we started talking about life as a software developer and working
  conditions and somehow digressed completely into discussions about game
  development. There is, for instance, an
  awesome [post-mortem talk about Diablo 1][d1]. And as you cannot have a
  discussions about game development without mentioning id software at least
  once, [Masters of Doom][] was also recommended ðŸ˜Š
- Closing the evening we talked about some ideas we have for the future of
  GoGraz. As a first step, we will create a Twitter account ([done][] ðŸ˜‰) but
  also regularly post meetup-notes in the future ðŸ˜Š
