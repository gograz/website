Right after an awesome Linuxtage weekend in Graz we're also going to have our April meetup. If everything goes as planned (not yet 100% certain), we will have a talk about some of the anti-patterns (or simple "just don't do it like that"s) in Go.

As always, weâ€™ll share the link to the call on the day of the event on meetup.com.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
