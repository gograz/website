Hey everyone ðŸ™‚

We are currently trying to organize a meetup again on September 15 at 18:30 at Spektral. Weâ€™re just working out some last details but this time itâ€™s going to be a test-run for a talk that Lovro Mazgon is going to give at GoLab in Florence next month about building a plugin system for Go applications using Webassembly. You can learn more on [gograz/ping#8](https://github.com/gograz/ping/issue/8)!

While Dorian cannot make it this time, we hope many of you can come to give Lovro a proper test crowd ðŸ™‚

If possible, please sign up on [events.graz.social](https://events.graz.social/events/ab47ff18-082e-416f-a0b4-22492098a6dc) but that's optional!
