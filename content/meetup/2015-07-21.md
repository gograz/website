For updates please take a look at our [Google+ event page](https://plus.google.com/events/ctkm8urroq2oi3m11ectlv3gme4).

Some of the things we talked about:

* [Grafana](http://grafana.org/): A metrics dashboard for Graphite and InfluxDB
  (et al.)
* [Go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz): Dimitry Vyukov's awesome fuzzy
  testing tool.
* [GopherCon 2015](http://www.gophercon.com/) happened and we are waiting for
  the videos ðŸ˜‰
* [DotGo 2015](http://www.dotgo.eu/) is taking place on November 9 in Paris and
  the speaker lineup looks simply amazing so far.
* Want to monitor stuff? Take a look at [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/)
  coming out of SoundCloud.
* Want to sync files? Take a look at [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for
  decentralized but still extremely easy folder synchronization.
* [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) and
  [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) ... I have no idea how and why we got
  into that rabbit hole...
