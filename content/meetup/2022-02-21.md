Welcome to the February edition of GoGraz! This month Sameer Oak is going to
give a talk about a data caching framework he's been working on!

Afterwards we'll have the usual discussion round and a quick review of what
happened since the last meetup.

## Talk: Data cache library (Sameer)

- The code is available on <https://github.com/sameeroak1110/datacache>.
- Originally developed for C/C++ but then ported to Go many years ago.
- Things like persistance loading/storing operations are pluggable using function types.
- 2 locks: One for the whole store and one for a single record.
- There can be multiple cache-keys be pointing at the same record in the cache. Each record also references those keys.
- Objects returned from the cache with the same key are the same object which allows for direct locking of such shared state.

## Misc.

- The Go Developers Network has also lots of other meetups happening within the next couple of days! Make sure to take a look at them at <https://www.meetup.com/pro/go>!
- Go 1.18 has a new [debug/buildinfo](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#debug/buildinfo) functionality which can be accessed also using `go version -m`!
- Linuxtage Graz is still looking for talks! [Submit yours!](https://pretalx.linuxtage.at/glt22/cfp)
- GopherCon India might happen around December somehow! Let's see!
- [Wails](https://wails.app/) is a frontend toolbox for Go.
