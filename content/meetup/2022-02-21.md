Welcome to the February edition of GoGraz! This month Sameer Oak is going to
give a talk about a data caching framework he's been working on!

Afterwards we'll have the usual discussion round and a quick review of what
happened since the last meetup.

## Talk: Data cache library (Sameer)

- The code is available on <https://github.com/sameeroak1110/datacache>.
- Originally developed for C/C++ but then ported to Go many years ago.
- Things like persistance loading/storing operations are pluggable using function types.
- 2 locks: One for the whole store and one for a single record.
- There can be multiple cache-keys be pointing at the same record in the cache. Each record also references those keys.
- Objects returned from the cache with the same key are the same object which allows for direct locking of such shared state.
