Welcome to the new year!
We are currently planning to have a little tutorial/introduction to using [Dagger][] in CI/CD pipelines.
It's not completely guaranteed that this will really work out, but it's looking good so far. 

As always, weâ€™ll share the link to the call on the day of the event on meetup.com.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
