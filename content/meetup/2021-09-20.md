After having to cancel at the last minute last time and due to the new infection wave we've decided to organize the September meetup again as remote event.

To make up for that Horst will give a quick intro GraphQL
(in general and looking at some tooling around GraphQL for Go).

The event will most likely be primarily in German but if that's not ideal for you, at least the talk can also be done in English ðŸ™‚

As always, we'll update the Meetup announcement with the final Zoom URL on the day of the event. On our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwryccmbbc/) you can also find all the details about this event.
