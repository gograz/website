This month we will most likely use Zoom again. At this point, there are no talks scheduled yet but if you want to show us something, please comment here or send a mail to talks@gograz.org 🙂

The Zoom link will be added on the day of the event.

You can find all the details also on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwrycchbwb/).
