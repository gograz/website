The year is coming to an end so it's the last chance we will get to talk about
Go this year! There is no fixed agenda yet but there may or may not be a retro
of the year and a quick look ahead. With some luck there might even be some
lighting talks ðŸ˜‰

Since it's not clear how the COVID-19 situation is going to be on the 20th this
meetup is going to take place remotely again. As always, a link to the Zoom
room will be shared on the day of the event ðŸ™‚

Btw.: If you want to present anything, please just comment down below! No
slides required ðŸ˜‰


As always, we'll update the Meetup announcement with the final Zoom URL on the
day of the event. On our [Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/282427686/) you
can also find all the details about this event.
