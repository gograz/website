Another month, pretty much the same story: Since the whole Corona situation
isn't going anywhere, we're once again going online with the meetup.

At this point, there aren't any talks scheduled but if you want to give a talk,
please ping us ðŸ˜€ One thing that we are going to do, no matter what, is a
rundown of all the things (that we are aware of) that happened around Go since
the last meetup!

As always, we'll update the Meetup announcement with the final Zoom URL on the
day of the event. On our [Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwryccnbxb/) you
can also find all the details about this event.
