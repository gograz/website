This time, the Go Developer Network is organizing an online event with multiple
speakers about everything related to learning Go or improving your skills!

We're going to do that online. The platform for this hasn't been selected yet
but as a fallback we might simply go with <https://meet.jit.si/gograz2020>.

You can find all the details on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/275830938/).
