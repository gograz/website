After the issues in February we hope that this month everything will run smoothly again! We will have at least one presentation (potentially) more and since we didnâ€™t have a chance to talk about FOSDEM and other events since January, it definitely wonâ€™t be boring!

Scheduled talk(s):

- Introduction to tracing using OpenTelemetry (Horst)

As always, weâ€™ll share the link to the call on the day of the event on meetup.com.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
