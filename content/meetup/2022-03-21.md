Welcome to the March edition of GoGraz! This month Christoph Lipautz is going
to give a talk about [pogo](https://github.com/eyeson-team/pogo), a GitLab
executor using [podman](https://podman.io/)!

Afterwards we'll have the usual discussion round and a quick review of what
happened since the last meetup.
