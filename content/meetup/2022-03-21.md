Welcome to the March edition of GoGraz! This month Christoph Lipautz is going
to give a talk about [pogo](https://github.com/eyeson-team/pogo), a GitLab
executor using [podman](https://podman.io/)!

Afterwards we'll have the usual discussion round and a quick review of what
happened since the last meetup.

## Pogo demo

- Goal was to basically become independent of Docker.
- [eyeson-team/pogo](https://github.com/eyeson-team/pogo)
- https://podman.io
- Registered as custom executor with the GitLab runner
- Security incident 2021 where someone managed to gain access through the CI infrastructure.
- pogo definitely has the best-places logo on any GitHub page ðŸ˜…
- Custom executors basically need to define handlers for the stages config, prepare, run, and cleanup. These handlers are basically just shell commands.
- Pogo can be configured to mount additional folders from the host machine depending on a job's tags.
- You can also specify a custom auth file to handle access to container registries specific to the executor.
- `gitlab-runner` will be run again by the executor in order to do the cache management etc.
