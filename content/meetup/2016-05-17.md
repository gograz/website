This time we will try something new: [Lightning Talks][]! These are short talks
of 5 minutes (more or less hard-capped) where you can quickly introduce an idea,
a cool project you've seen, or a new library you've just tried.

No sign-up is required but please prepare a few slides. If you can't bring your
own laptop, upload the slides somewhere so that they can't be accessed from
another laptop ðŸ™‚
