We hope you had a good start into the new year. Despite (or perhaps because of)
being on winter holidays we didn‚Äôt really have the time to prepare anything
elaborate for the first GoGraz instalment of the year. We will still have the
usual rundown of what happened since last month in the Go community and can
then have discussions, lighting talks, code-review, whatever we feel like :-)

If you want to give a quick presentation of a new tool you‚Äôve stumbled upon or
some technique you‚Äôve tried, please just come and share your knowledge! No need
sign up for a ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù (5-15min). If you want more time, please just
send a mail to [talks@gograz.org](mailto:talks@gograz.org). This is just to let
us know in advance so that we can add your talk to the event notes!

Also: If you have some non-confidential piece of code that you want to have
reviewed, we can also do that üòÄ


As always, we'll update the Meetup announcement with the final Zoom URL on the
day of the event. On our [Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/283095160/) you
can also find all the details about this event.
