We hope you had a good start into the new year. Despite (or perhaps because of)
being on winter holidays we didn‚Äôt really have the time to prepare anything
elaborate for the first GoGraz instalment of the year. We will still have the
usual rundown of what happened since last month in the Go community and can
then have discussions, lighting talks, code-review, whatever we feel like :-)

If you want to give a quick presentation of a new tool you‚Äôve stumbled upon or
some technique you‚Äôve tried, please just come and share your knowledge! No need
sign up for a ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù (5-15min). If you want more time, please just
send a mail to [talks@gograz.org](mailto:talks@gograz.org). This is just to let
us know in advance so that we can add your talk to the event notes!

Also: If you have some non-confidential piece of code that you want to have
reviewed, we can also do that üòÄ


As always, we'll update the Meetup announcement with the final Zoom URL on the
day of the event. On our [Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/283095160/) you
can also find all the details about this event.

## What happened since last month
- [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) is now at v2
- [Sonic](https://github.com/bytedance/sonic) is another JSON toolkit that has now reached v1.0.0
- New tutorials for generics and fuzzing which will arrive with 1.18: <https://go.dev/blog/tutorials-go1.18>
- [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero) 1.8
- [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) 1.8

## Outlook
- FOSDEM on Feb 5 and Feb 6 once again with a dedicated [Go devroom](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/go/) and interesting talks!
- Go 1.18 will be released some time in February
- As always, there are tons of other meetups happening around the world. Many of them are now part of the Go Developer Network and can be found on https://www.meetup.com/pro/go.

## Ping repository
- <https://github.com/gograz/ping>
- Building a repository/backlog of talk ideas
- Everyone can suggest talks by creating a ticket in there
- During the meetups we look over the open tickets and work out if someone wants to look into one of these topics and prepare a talk for the upcoming months.

## Things we stumbled upon
- [Grazer Linuxtage](https://www.linuxtage.at/de/) will be on-site again this
  year (hopefully!!!!): 2022-04-22 (workshops) and 2022-04-23 (talks)
- Embedding all the things!
- ‚ÄúDelve is now running our program and has paused at the breakpoint on line
  19. We can see that Go has created three goroutines, all of which have halted
  at line 19. The entire Go program was paused at that point time, and that is
  why the main goroutine didn‚Äôt manage to spawn the rest of the goroutines.‚Äù
