## Notes

This time we started off at our friends at
[TAO Software](https://software.tao.at/) who let us use their offices once
again. Big thanks for that! There these and other topics were discussed:

- [Docker][] and in particular how everyone was using it or how far they've come
  in getting to know it. New'ish initiatives like Docker for Mac and Docker for
  Windows will definitely help those of us primarily using either of these
  platforms for development.
- We also talked a little bit about the [go-qml][] project and other tools for
  working in GUI applications using Go.
- As happens basically every time developers meet, there was also quite a lot of
  talking about editors and [VS Code][] in particular, which is getting more and
  more attractive as an [Atom][] alternative thanks to its great support for Go
  and it already being quite performant.

Since the weather was still pretty nice (no lightning storms punishing those who
argue about editors) we went to a nearby Pub to conclude the meetup in style ðŸ˜‰
