April is here and the weather is pretty much what it should be this month: a mess. This won't stop us from having our regular meetup, though! Due to the Easter holidays it's not yet clear if we'll have any talks, though. As always, if you want to present something or just have some questions that you think might be answered by the group, please just come and show/ask ðŸ™‚
