Just in time for the 10th anniversary of GoGraz we are going to have another meetup at Spektral with impulse/lightning talks, discussions, perhaps some experiments, and (if all goes as planned) Pizza!

---

So what happened? We had 4 lightning talks and lots of discussions afterwards about topics not necessarily related to Go!

- Christoph gave us a short introduction into the way he keeps track of his working ours using a custom plain-text file format and [stopwatch](https://github.com/unused/stopwatch)
- I shared some approaches on how to [write GitHub Actions using Go](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HESLHVdStUTxlo68GlOhZv8zUcDm2VoN6PFHsi2ohEk/edit?usp=sharing)
- Mathias gave us a tour through [Excelize](https://github.com/qax-os/excelize), showing us a few of the less so nice aspects of it
- And last but not least, Dorian provided a quick tour through the [Elvish Shell](https://elv.sh/)

Some other tools that were mentioned:

- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) as replacement for the cd command with some nice improvements
- [zasper](https://zasper.io/): Similiar to Jupyter but using Go
- [marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker): PDF to Markdown convert
- [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown): A tool by Microsoft for converting Office documents and more to Markdown
