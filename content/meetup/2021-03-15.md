This time Christoph gave an introduction about [Gio][1], a toolkit for building
UIs in Go!

Afterwards we had a bit of a discussion in which Matthias dropped the following
two libraries for further consideration:

- [segmentio/ksuid](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid) as an alternative to
  various UUID variants
- [shopspring/decimal](https://github.com/shopspring/decimal) for working with
  fixed-point decimal numbers (and monetary values in particular)

You can find all the details also on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwryccfbtb/).
