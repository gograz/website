After a long time we will try to revive this meetup group. There will be news, discussions, and hopefully some lightning talks about the Go programming language and interesting projects in that eco-system. A big part of this particular meeting will also revolve around planning the future of this meetup including the schedule and the content.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€

We talked a lot about how weâ€™ve organized the meetup in the past and also discussed some ideas for the future. In the end, we opted to starting with one event roughly per quarter. The next time we meet will be in early January with a focus on lightning talks (or at least short talks). I think we already have quite a few in the backlog given all the discussions on Tuesday ðŸ™‚

Some of the other things that were mentioned:

- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev): A toolchain for generating Go code out of SQL queries so that you have a type-safe interface to your queries.
- [bleve](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve): Indexing library for Go that you can use as a full-text search engine without having to run something external like OpenSearch.
- [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt): Similar to `go fmt` but stricter
- [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev): An additional security layer for running untrusted containers
- [inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app): Knowledge management platform based around Markdown files available on all major platforms, looks similar to something like Obsidian.
- [wasilib](https://github.com/wasilib): Collection of libraries and tools compiled with WASI. There is for instance  prettier package that you can then run natively with Go.
