Spring is finally here and it would be awesome if we could use the fine weather to do an in-person meeting somewhere outside again! At this point we're aiming for somewhere around Lendplatz in Graz. Topic-wise, nothing has been planned yet, but given the outdoor location, lightning talks are definitely an option ðŸ˜ƒ

If the weather turns bad, we will probably try to also make a reservation at a nearby restaurant depending on the number of sign-ups.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
