Since FOSDEM is just over we will most likely focus on some of the topics from
there and also the changes that come with Go 1.16.

On the latter topic, Horst Gutmann will present some of his highlights that
will be part of 1.16 in a quick talk.

We're going to do that online. The platform for this hasn't been selected yet
but as a fallback we might simply go with <https://meet.jit.si/gograz2020>.

## Schedule (more or less)

- **19:00:** Welcome
- **19:10:** Highlights of Go 1.16 ([Horst Gutmann](https://zerokspot.com))
- **19:40:** Discussion (and lightning talk if someone wants to present
  something)

You can find all the details also on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwryccdbtb/).
