For updates please take a look at our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/240958496/).

As the weather was simply too nice to sit inside even the nicest office, we opted for a free table on the Lendplatz with some drinks and pizza! Sadly, we forgot to leave a not where we were. Sorry about that ðŸ˜”

As with last time we somehow focused on web-related topics, starting off with [casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/README.md): A toolkit for modelling rules which can be used, for instance, for handling authorisation rule-sets on website. There is even already a [middleware](https://github.com/casbin/chi-authz) that can be used directly with chi!

Mario also stumbled upon another nice middleware for enforcing secure defaults in Go web-applications called [secure](https://github.com/unrolled/secure) by Cory Jacobsen.
