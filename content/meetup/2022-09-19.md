The summer break is over and we hope you enjoyed your vacation if you had one. Weâ€™d also like to take the opportunity and move GoGraz out of the summer hibernation again by meeting up in person at Lendplatz on 2022-09-19 at 19:00 in front of Tropicante. There may even be an impromptu presentation about OpenPolicyAgent!

If the weather turns out to be bad we will fall back to Zoom. The decision will most likely be made on the Sunday before the event.

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
