## Notes

- The next meetup will take place on 9 September, most likely at the
  same venue as always just with some talks and possibly lighting
  talks. We still have to do some advertising for that :-)
- Amazon has released a [website for the PartiQL
  language](https://partiql.org/), which aims to enhance SQL with
  support for semistructured and nested data.
- There is going to be a [Rust meetup on 28
  August](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Rust-Meetup/events/263703640/)
  at Lab10!
- The people behing Traefik announced a new Go interpreter called
  [Yaegi](https://github.com/containous/yaegi).

### Mostly not tech-related notes

- Revolut seems to offer transactions at interbank-rates.
- Klarna offers things like down payments, credit checks etc. It's
  platform is built on top of Erlang. (How they are dealing with
  GDPR-requirements for credit rating checks is a different topic...)
- Post.at, Google, and Amazon as large-scale data collectors
  - [Talk by Kartharina
    Nocun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbN6R6MubSI) about here
    experience with Amazon
  - Recently, there has been a similar video on HackerNews about
    Google. @Dorian: Can you perhaps remember its name?
- Influence of large corporations and propaganda in general on the
  public opinion
  - Do only large players benefit from data analysis?
