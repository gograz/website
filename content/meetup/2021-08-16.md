After taking advantage of the great weather last month, the location for the
August meetup hasn't been decided yet. As for the options, we could either do
it remote or meet somewhere in Graz again ðŸ™‚

In any case, if all things go as planned, Horst will give a quick intro GraphQL
(in general and looking at some tooling around GraphQL for Go).

We'll update this page, the meetup.com entry and Twitter/Mastodon/Reddit once
it's clear where the meetup will take place ðŸ˜€

You can find all the details also on our
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Graz-Open-Source-Meetup/events/fxlkwrycclbvb/).
