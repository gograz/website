## Notes

* At the latest dotGo conference in Paris earlier this month Liz Rice gave an
  amazing talk in which she build a [simple
  debugger](https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/11/liz-rice-debuggers-from-scratch)
  using some of syscall-helpers available in Go.
* [Mario][] has been writing a authentication service for the last couple of
  months for one of his projects and is thinking about releasing it. While
  talking about that we also came across [authn][] which does something
  similar. [Horst][] mentioned that he would look into it.
* Afterwards we talked a little bit about secret stores as Horst was starting
  to roll out [Vault][] in a couple of his projects. At the last CraftConf in
  Budapest there was a talk by [Diogo Monica][] about how Docker Swarm is
  dealing with secrets. Sadly, we couldn't find a recording of this talk so
  far.
* A heated discussion about the merrits of ORMs in Go followed with Mario and
  Horst being in favor of query builders and Lukas trying to play devil's
  advocate.
* Everybody seems to love Firefox Quantum so far ❤️ There is also an extension
  available for it that allows to manage multiple profiles within the same
  window which is useful if you have multiple accounts for the same service for
  work and personal use: [Multi-account containers][]
