A quick rundown of the most important topics we discussed during the
meetup:

## Proposal for a new date

For the last couple of years we've been meeting every month on the 3rd
Tuesday. Sadly, this is also the date picked by the
[Infracoders](https://www.meetup.com/Infracoders-Graz/) meetup. In
order to get rid of this collision and be an option for their
attendees again, we thought about moving the GoGraz meetup to another
day. Right now, we prefer the second Monday of each month but will
contact all the user-groups in Graz where we think we share a
potential audience for their feedback.

## vienna.go summer party

On June 22 vienna.go is organizing a summer party in Klosterneuburg!
You can find the details [on their meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/vienna-go-Vienna-Go-User-Group/events/261011039/).

## September event

We will try to organize a more organized and simply more attractive
GoGraz meetup in September after everyone is back from vacation. We
want to finally get en-par with our friends from PyGraz ;-)

For that we are looking for speakers who'd be willing to give either a
lightning talk (5-10 min) or a full presentation (20-30
min). Depending on the feedback we will also contact various potential
venues for the event. If you want to help or simply want to stay up to
date, please take a look at our [planning
board](https://github.com/gograz/planning).
