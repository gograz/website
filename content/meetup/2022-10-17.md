Autumn is now officially here and in order to avoid a cold surprise we'll meet up in October online again!
If everything goes as planned then Christoph will give a talk about [how video meetings are controlled and managed at eyeson using Go](https://github.com/gograz/ping/issues/6).

Further details will be announced here and on meetup.com when available ðŸ™‚

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€

## Notes 
### Presentation

Controlling videos and meetings with Go in [eyeson][] by Christoph ([original ticket](https://github.com/gograz/ping/issues/6)) ðŸ˜€

- Presentation from June at the WeAreDevelopers conference in Berlin incl. workshop (90 min)
- eyeson:
	- API for your own video solutions
	- Go-client for instance for providing an RTSP server for streaming from a drone
	- Company is quite diverse with Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust and more
	- You can also have free meetings as long as you only have no parallel calls.
	- 1000 minutes per API key per month for the free developer tier
- **eyeson Single Stream** is the patentend mixing system that basically allows you to merge various data source into a single data stream that is then pushed to the end users. All communication happens through central components to support this mixing and allows for each user to only get a single stream and not have to handle connections to all participants.
- Demo application using <https://gofiber.io>: <https://github.com/eyeson-team/workshop-video-platform>
- Meeting details etc. can be sent out via webhooks to notify external services
- pion: WebRTC implementation in Go
- [WebRTC Weekly](https://webrtcweekly.com/) newsletter

### Next meetups(s):

- 2022-11-21, 19:00 Europe/Vienna, most likely online again. Perhaps we'll hear a talk by Matthias ðŸ˜€
