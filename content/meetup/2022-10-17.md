Autumn is now officially here and in order to avoid a cold surprise we'll meet up in October online again!
If everything goes as planned then Christoph will give a talk about [how video meetings are controlled and managed at eyeson using Go](https://github.com/gograz/ping/issues/6).

Further details will be announced here and on meetup.com when available ðŸ™‚

Hope to see you there ðŸ˜€
